Deep learning project for a master's course (see description.pdf):

Classify pictures into different categories.

We worked on a colab notebook, so folder.zip (ordered trainset) and testset.zip should be placed on google drive to import them.

trainset.zip was given, we used the script ```put_into_folders.sh``` to create the ordered dataset.
